In 2019/20, there were 2.46 million students in UK higher education institutions and the number of total accepted applicants for UK undergraduate courses reached a record high in 2020. Many of these students are required to partake in group projects and dissertations to complete their studies which, often leaves professors, course directors and supervisors to compose project specifications for their students. Although supervisors often offer interesting projects, these exercises are created purely to facilitate a student in displaying their hard-work, intelligence and expertise within a specific field and does not allow students to provide a direct impact on the economy. Some supervisors are often able to find external partners for their students but, this process can often be difficult and time consuming.

UNILINX aims to make this process easier. We want to provide a platform for firms to reach out to students and supervisors with real-world challenges for potential project ideas. Similarly, UNILINX will offer the ability to students and supervisors to post prospective projects for the support of third parties. By achieving this, we will be providing students with the opportunity to gain experience within industry whilst also studying for their university degrees. We also aim to circumvent some of the challenges of gaining employment by allowing students to display their talent and ability to a potential future employer.
